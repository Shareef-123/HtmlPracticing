         <p>I refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
         These tasks can range from simple ones such as recognizing speech or images to complex ones such as playing chess or driving a
          car. At its core, AI involves creating algorithms that can learn from data inputs and make decisions based on that data.
        </p> 
        
       
        
       <p style="color:blue;"> Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from
         data without being explicitly programmed. It involves using algorithms that can automatically improve their performance over
          time by learning from past experiences. In other words, instead of being given specific instructions on what to do, machine 
          learning algorithms are trained on large datasets so they can identify patterns and make predictions based on new data.</p>
        
        <p> AI and ML are often used together because machine learning provides the foundation for many
          AI applications. For example, image recognition involves teaching a machine learning algorithm to identify patterns in
           images so it can recognize specific objects or people. Once the algorithm has learned these patterns, it can be integrated 
           into an AI system that uses this information to make decisions.</p>
